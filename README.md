## Description

A web application that allows you to generate a QR code for your WiFi network. Simply enter your WiFi SSID (name) and password, and the app will generate a QR code that can be scanned by devices to easily connect to your WiFi network.

This is a client-side to-do web application built using vanilla JavaScript, custom CSS with neubrutalism UI inspiration, and HTML. It uses the QRCode.js library to generate the QR code. The app is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
